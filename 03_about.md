###Software Developer
Working with Swift since it was announced and released as a beta.
iOS developer with a few independent apps on the store since iOS 5.


###Sports
I like running in the early morning ... really early.

Master swimmer since age 25. Sadly now I can't practice it due to time constraints :-(

Rugby when I was really young: from 8 to 10. It gave me a strong and valuable _inprinting_
